Output directory structure is as follows:

<studydir>|-<sub1>-------|-anat-|<sub>_T1w.nii.gz....
                         |-func-|<session1>.nii.gz ...
                                |<session2>.nii.gz ...


* The T1 weighted image is processed using BrainSuite and SVReg. The files generated by BrainSuite and SVReg module of BrainSuite are stored in the `anat` directory. 
* The fMRI data is processed and outputs are stored in `func` directory.
* <sub>_<sess>_32k.GOrd.mat is the fMRI data in the grayordinate format, as a nodex x time matrix.
* <sub>_<sess>_32k.GOrd.filt.mat is the GPDF filtered output stored in the grayordinate format, as a nodex x time matrix.

Rest of the files are intermediate outputs as defined by the fMRi processing script.
