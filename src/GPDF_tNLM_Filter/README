Usage
========================================

Function call:
[dataSm, output] = tNLMGPDF(data, option);

data - a V x T matrix where V is the number of vertices and T is the number of time samples

option - optional parameters, call function without input parameter to obtain the default options, i.e. option = tNLMGPDF();
	option.normalization - how to normalize the data after filtering
		0 - no normalization
		1 - zero mean (default)
		2 - zero mean and unit variance
	option.selfWeightMode - what weight is assigned to the data point that is being filtered
		0 - one
		1 - same as the second largest weight (default)
		2 - zero
	option.FPR - false positive rate regariding the noise distribution (default = 0.001)
	option.memoryLimit - specifiy the memory limit
		a positive number - memory limit in GB
		'auto' - try to detect available memory automatically (only works for Linux now)
    option.numCPU - specify the number of cpu cores used for parallel processing
        a positive integer - number of cpu cores
        'auto' - try to detect the max number of cpu cores automatically and use the max number - 1 for parallel processing
	option.isPlot - binary flag indicating whether the weighting function and the distributions will be shown (default = false)
	option.isVerbose - binary flag indicating the verboseness of information printing (default = true)
	option.SCBFile - a file that stores the sample correlation basis (default = SCB.mat in the current directory)

dataSm - filtered data

output - other intermediate result
	output.r - sample correlation axis
	output.h - optimized parameter h
	output.w - kernel weight as a function of r
    output.B - actual filtering weights for all vertices

also see demo.m for example

Notes
========================================

* The input data for fMRI study should be concatenated data from both hemispheres.
* For each different length of fMRI recordings (T), the sample correlation basis needs to be re-pre-calculated once. This will take a while to finish. It will take even longer if you don't have a multi-core CPU. Hence, it is strongly recommended to pre-compute the basis before filtering the fMRI data, especially if you want to process a group of subject in batch.
