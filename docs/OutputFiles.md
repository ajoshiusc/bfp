Output directory structure is as follows:

<studydir>|-<sub1>-------|-anat-|<sub>_T1w.nii.gz....
                         |-func-|<session1>.nii.gz ...
                                |<session2>.nii.gz ...


The T1 weighted image is processed using BrainSuite. The files generated by BrainSuite and SVReg module of BrainSuite are stored in the `anat` directory. The fMRI data is processed and outputs are stored in `func` directory.
